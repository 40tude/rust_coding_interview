## How to
* One directory per chapter (01_two_pointers ... 19_math_and_geometry)
* In the directories, the number at the beginning of the filename (e.g., ``10_xxx.ipynb``, ``14_yyy.ipynb``) corresponds to the page number in the book.
* When the filename starts with `bonus_` the exercice is one of the ``bonus.pdf`` 
* A copy of ``bonus.pdf`` is available in the ``./assets`` directory
* If you don't run Rust code in Jupyter Notebook, you can copy'n paste the code of the cells in the [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/)
    * Just make sure to uncomment the ``fn main(){`` line 

## In most notebooks
* There is a recap of the challenge at the top of the page
* **The point** : The tip or the trick to keep in mind about the puzzle
* **Complexity** : Recap of the time & space complexities
* **About Rust** :
    * list of function calls, idioms, constructs...
    * There is no order, no priority
    * This is mostly for me
    * Items may be repeated if I can't remember
    * I confirm (or not) if the code has been executed in the [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/)
* There may be cells with code that doesn't work and I explain why
* There may be different versions of the same solution. I explain the changes from one version to the next.



## This may help
* The page where I explain how to [**Use Rust in Jupyter Notebooks on Windows**](https://www.40tude.fr/docs/06_programmation/rust/001_rust_jupyter/rust_jupyter.html)
* [**My repo with code in Python**](https://github.com/40tude/py_coding_interview). 
    * In the [README](https://github.com/40tude/py_coding_interview/blob/main/README.md) I explain why I believe it is better to use Jupyter Notebooks in this learning context.
