## How to
* One directory per chapter (01_two_pointers ... 19_math_and_geometry)
* In the directories, the number at the beginning of the filename (e.g., ``10_xxx.ipynb``, ``14_yyy.ipynb``) corresponds to the page number in the book.
* When the filename starts with `bonus_` the exercice is one of the ``bonus.pdf`` 
* A copy of ``bonus.pdf`` is available in the ``./assets`` directory

## This may help
* The page where I explain how to [**Use Rust in Jupyter Notebooks on Windows**](https://www.40tude.fr/docs/06_programmation/rust/001_rust_jupyter/rust_jupyter.html)
* [**My repo with code in Python**](https://github.com/40tude/py_coding_interview). 
    * In the [README](https://github.com/40tude/py_coding_interview/blob/main/README.md) I explain why I believe it is better to use Jupyter Notebooks in this learning context.
